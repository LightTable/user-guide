# Advanced Functionality

### Inline Documentation

> Note: This functionality is dependent on the language plugin associated with the file.

With your cursor on a function, it is possible to see the documentation at a glance. Simply press `Ctrl-D` and any documentation found will be displayed inline in the editor. To hide the documentation, either press `Ctrl-D` again, or right click the box and select clear.

### Language Documentation Pane

> Note: This functionality is dependent on the language plugin associated with the file.

The language documentation pane makes it possible to search a language's documentation without ever leaving Light Table. To open the pane, press Ctrl-Shift-D or search for '' in the Command pane.

### Jump to Definition - Clojure(Script)

The default keybinding to jump to a definition at the cursor is `Ctrl-.` and `Ctrl-,` to go back to the original cursor position. This is useful when you want to checkout another function's definition, or perhaps modify it.

### Watches

### Autocomplete

Auto-complete is bound to the Tab key if there's some non-space character preceding the cursor, otherwise a tab is inserted.

### Console

When you print from a client, it will appear in the Console, which can be opened by clicking the blue number in the bottom right corner of the editor, from the `View` menu, or by using the `Console: Toggle console` command. STDOUT and STDERR are written to the console.
