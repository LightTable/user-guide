# For Emac Users

## Intro

Welcome! Contributions to help fellow Emacs users are appreciated.

To use Light Table as an Emacs user, install [the Emacs plugin](https://github.com/LightTable/Emacs). The plugin uses [CodeMirror's implementation](https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/blob/master/keymap/emacs.js). While CodeMirror's implementation does not have all of Emacs's features, it has a number of its core primitives. It also has the significant advantage of being a small, readable, well-tested implementation that has a low barrier of entry to new contributors.

## Plugins


Some emacs-related plugins to consider installing:

* [Claire](https://github.com/joshuafcole/Claire) - Provides ido-mode-like editing
* [Bufferize](https://github.com/Frozenlock/Bufferize) - Provides keybindings for similar buffer navigation
* [Describe Key](https://github.com/Frozenlock/describe-key) - Provides `ctrl-h k` equivalent
