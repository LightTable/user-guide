# Example Workflow - Clojure

### Open Project Folder

### Connect

### Do Some Work

### Look up Documentation

### Jump to Definition

### Evaluate

To evaluate the form at the cursor position use `Ctrl-Enter` or, in the command pane, use `Eval: Eval a form in editor`. This will evaluate the outer-most form the cursor is touching, such as a function definition.

To evaluate the entire file, use `Ctrl-Shift-Enter` or, in the command pane, use `Eval: Eval editor contents`. As all forms in the file will be evaluated, this can be useful to quickly propagate any changes made to commonly used functions near the top of the namespace.
